## Hello Fetch!

Thank you for putting down the robots for a few minutes to consider this application, just as I have put them down to write this. Fetch has an awesome reputation among my Co-Workers and other friends in Industry, and I would be thrilled to join Fetch this summer as an intern. I'm most interested and experienced in robot simulation, but I'm also excited to learn about other areas like navigation and machine learning.

Most of my recent experience has been with ROS and Gazebo. I spent my sophomore year working on a project called FRCSim, a joint effort by OSRF and WPI. The goal is to enable high school students participating in FIRST robotics to not only build and write robot code, but also test their design and programming in simulation using Gazebo. The FRCSim project presets endless challenges, ranging from targeting inexperienced users, to developing cross-platform, multi-language, multi-architecture programs and tools, to the delivery and testing. I've learned so much about writing portable code, managing a complex build system, and understanding and managing a deployment cycle. I would like to share that same struggle and enthusiasm with Fetch! This past summer I was doing research at Georgia Tech under Dr. Sonia Chernova. I was working with a mobile robot, and my goal was to build on the ROS nav stack so that we could provide demonstrations and corrections when the robot makes a mistake. As a part of this project, I did research on various search and navigation techniques, machine learning, and learning from demonstration.

At Fetch, I'd like to work on something in the intersection of robotics and machine learning. I would be willing to help maintain and improve the core packages of the ROS nav stack, including costmap_2d, move_base, and others. I've been studying various machine learning techniques both in classes and on my own time, and would be interested in learning more about possible uses for intelligent robot navigation.

I hope to hear from you soon,
