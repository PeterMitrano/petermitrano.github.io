<h2>Hello Anki!</h2>
<p>Thank you for putting down the robots for a few minutes to consider this application, just as I have put them down to write this. I'm interested in a summer internship. Specifically, I want to work on Cozmo. I'm most interested and experienced in robot simulation, but I'd love to put my search &amp; planning knowledge to the test at Anki. This past summer, I was doing research under Dr Sonia Chernova at Georgia Tech, a former advisor of mine from WPI. I worked in her lab as a freshman, and had the opportunity to work in her lab again this summer. My research focused on mobile robots that can improve their navigation from demonstration. There are many existing SLAM packages, and some of them are very good, but none of them are perfect, and all of them require hand-tuning dozens of parameters. My goal was to have a remote operator step-in when the robot makes a mistake and provide a correction to the robot, and use that correction to improve navigation in the future. This way, the robot will over time become more accustomed to the nuances of it's environment and require less oversight. Along those lines, I have experience with many search algorithms, including several variations of A<em> (MHA</em>, WA<em>, RA</em>), so learning a few more would be very easy.</p>
<p>Aside from my technical background, I also really, really, want to work on interactive robots. HRI has always been interesting to me, and companionship robots and interactive robots in the US are finally becoming acceptable to the general public. I've also had the unique opportunity to work with Jibo at a hackathon, and while Jibo has made huge strides towards making a lovable robot, they're severely lacking in the intelligence category. In Cozmo, I see the deliberate choice to make be small and cute so we expect less of its intelligence and are more easily impressed. I see the reuse of the kinds of sounds used by well loved robot companions like Wall-E and R2D2. I see the animation talent being put into the movements and graphics. I see respect for the developer community by providing an SDK that goes all the way down to raw sensor values. Most importantly, I think Cozmo, and Anki as whole, has incredible potential to finally bring intelligent robots into the lives of ordinary Americans. I'd like to share both my technical experience and the personal motivation with Anki.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon,
