<p>
  I am currently seeking entrance to PhD programs in Robotics and Machine Learning. My interests and qualifications are
  detailed below.
</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests include Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks. I have read <em>Reinforcement
  Learning</em> by Sutton & Barto cover to cover, and have published about a generative music system using RNNs at a
  small workshop.
</p>

<p>As a freshman at WPI, I worked as a research assistant for Russell Torris, under Dr. Sonia Chernova. I also worked
  with Dr.
  Chernova for a summer at Georgia Tech. I was treated as a graduate student, and my research focused on using
  demonstration to improve indoor robot navigation.</p>

<p>I am currently working with Dr. Scott Barton. Our research together is centered around machine learning and music. As
  a trained musician, this is an interesting application of machine learning.</p>

<h3>Papers</h3>
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318041455_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_to_Judge_Fitness_in_Musical_Genetic_Algorithms">Using
  Recurrent Neural Networks to Judge Fitness in Musical Genetic Algorithms</a>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p><strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> - <em>BS in Computer Science, BS in Robotics Engineering</em></p>
<p>3.94 GPA</p>
<p>Relevant coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intro to AI</li>
  <li>Deep Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Swarm Intelligence</li>
  <li>Foundations of Computer Science</li>
  <li>Numerical Methods for Calculus</li>
  <li>Discrete Math</li>
  <li>Linear Algebra</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internships</h2>
<h3>Uber ATG Pittsburgh</h3>
<p>I worked on the problem of predicting future paths of actors detected by the autonomous vehicle. My work included
  both software engineering and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Open Source Robotics</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://www.osrfoundation.org/">OSRF</a>, I worked on the Gazebo robot simulator. I worked on getting
  Gazebo running on windows, and on allowing high school students in the FIRST Robotics Competition to use Gazebo as a
  simulator for their robots.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>

I currently have 150 repositories on <a href="https://github.com/PeterMitrano">my github.</a> My favorite projects include

<ul>
  <li>SmartMouse. A Maze solving robot competition</li>
  <li>Climb. Android app + full stack web app for rock climbers who want to track their gym training.</li>
  <li>OpenAI Gym. Playing around with solutions to OpenAI's Gym environments</li>
</ul>
