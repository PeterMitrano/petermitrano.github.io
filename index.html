  <h1>Peter Mitrano</h1>
</header>
<p>
  I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan currently advised by Professr Dmitry Berenson. I started in the fall of 2018 after I completed my Bachelors in Robotics Engineering and Bachelors in Computer Science at WPI.
</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests include planning and learning for robotics, controls, and machine learning. I have read <em>Reinforcement
  Learning</em> by Sutton & Barto cover to cover, and have published about a generative music system using RNNs at a
  small workshop.
</p>

<p>As a freshman at WPI, I worked as a research assistant for Russell Torris, under Dr. Sonia Chernova. I also worked
  with Dr.
  Chernova for a summer at Georgia Tech. I was treated as a graduate student, and my research focused on using
  demonstration to improve indoor robot navigation.</p>

<p>I am currently working with Professor Calo Pinciroli on a swarm robotics project. We are studing the space of possible behaviors for memoryless computeless robots, specifically showing that they are capable of n-class segregation with a single primitive sensor and no communication.</p>

<p>I am also currently working with Professor Scott Barton. Our research together is centered around machine learning and music. As
  a trained musician, this is an interesting application of machine learning.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p><strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> - <em>BS in Computer Science, BS in Robotics Engineering</em></p>
<p>3.95 GPA</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>

  <h3>Uber ATG Pittsburgh</h3>
  <p>I worked on the problem of predicting future paths of actors detected by the autonomous vehicle. My work included
  both software engineering and machine learning.</p>

  <h3>Open Source Robotics</h3>
  <p>At <a href="https://www.osrfoundation.org/">OSRF</a>, I worked on the Gazebo robot simulator. I worked on getting
    Gazebo running on windows, and on allowing high school students in the FIRST Robotics Competition to use Gazebo as a
    simulator for their robots.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

I currently have 170+ repositories on <a href="https://github.com/PeterMitrano">my github.</a> My favorite projects include

<ul>
  <li>SmartMouse. A Maze solving robot competition</li>
  <li>Climb. Android app + full stack web app for rock climbers who want to track their gym training.</li>
  <li>OpenAI Gym. Playing around with solutions to OpenAI's Gym environments</li>
</ul>
