<p>
  I am currently seeking entrance to PhD programs in Robotics and Machine Learning. My interests and qualifications are
  detailed below.
</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests include Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks. I have read <em>Reinforcement
  Learning</em> by Sutton & Barto cover to cover, and have published about a generative music system using RNNs at a
  small workshop. I am particularly interested in proving theoretical guarantees about neural networks and formulating
  principled approximations for more tractable algorithms.
</p>

<h3>RAIL Lab at WPI</h3>
<p>As a freshman, I worked as a research assistant</p>
<h3>RAIL Lab at GT</h3>
<p>I did my own fucking research</p>

<h3>Papers</h3>
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318041455_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_to_Judge_Fitness_in_Musical_Genetic_Algorithms">Using
  Recurrent Neural Networks to Judge Fitness in Musical Genetic Algorithms</a>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p><strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> - <em>BS in Computer Science, BS in Robotics Engineering</em></p>
<p>3.94 GPA</p>
<p>Relevant coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intro to AI</li>
  <li>Deep Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Swarm Intelligence</li>
  <li>Foundations of Computer Science</li>
  <li>Numerical Methods for Calculus</li>
  <li>Discrete Math</li>
  <li>Linear Algebra</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internships</h2>
<h3>Uber ATG Pittsburgh</h3>
<p>I worked on the problem of predicting future paths of actors detected by the autonomous vehicle. My work included
  both software engineering and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Open Source Robotics</h3>
<p>At OSRF, I worked on the Gazebo robot simulator. My project </p>
